Greetings to all of you curious minds and welcome to my Google homepage clone (kind of)! In this project I will demonstrate the html and css capabilities I've acquired thus far. It's not much, but I find solace in the assurance of a road ahead that can only take me up and beyond from where I'm at. To YOU reading this, YOU who might have begun your own journey, I salute you. Let's meet on the top, and bask, and rejoice, and be thankful, and gaze together at the long journey still ahead of us!
